# Intro
xmlux is just the beginning of a my XML project. 
It is an ambitious project that needs a great effort, for this reason it is also open to
contributors; now I'm still only in the primordial stage of the project. 
 
It handles, compiles, formats, edits, manipulates XML file; it wants to be a XML suite.

 
# Prerequisites and dependencies
You should know something of xml language, you should know xml fundamentals, to understand
what xmlux does. If you need to study basic subjects or advanced matters, you could 
refer e.g. to Elliotte Rusty Harold's XML works, to w3c's XML space.  

You have to install:
GNU coreutils;
vim and gvim;
bash, java, sed, grep, etc.


# Installing and help
I thought xmlux for a Unix system, I tested it in a Unix system.
```bash
tar xvf xmlux-$version.tar.xz
cd xmlux-$version
./install-sh
systemctl reboot
xmlux -h
xmluxc -h
```

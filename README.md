# Intro
It handles, compiles, formats, edits, manipulates XML file; it wants to be a XML suite.

 
# Prerequisites and dependencies
You should know something of xml language, you should know xml fundamentals, to understand
what xmlux does. If you need to study basic subjects or advanced matters, you could 
refer e.g. to Elliotte Rusty Harold's XML works, to w3c's XML space.  

You have to install:
GNU coreutils;
vim and gvim;
bash, java, sed, grep, etc.

# Intro
xmlux is just the beginning of a my XML project. 
It is an ambitious project that needs a great effort, for this reason it is also open to
contributors; now I'm still only in the primordial stage of the project. 
 
It handles, compiles, formats, edits XML file; it wants to be a XML suite.  It'll integrate
some java program soon too.  
  
This first version sees only a type of available document class, the matter document
class. The xml scientific usage is more than this, but I believe that matter document
class is useful however, and it is  a good "theme" to acquire familiarity with XML
language and xmlux. 
  
My goal consists, with modesty and if I'll be able, in making for XML – by my way –
something like Leslie Leslie Lamport did for TeX. So I'm opened to contributors' works. 
This doc document xmluxDoc.xml is written by xmlux entirely.  If you study
README/xmluxDoc-xmlux codex, you'll understand xmlux better. I offer it in various usage
combination.
The chronological order of your studying should be:
1) *.lmx 
2) *.css 
3) *.xml 
4) *.xmlp (if you want understand other xmlux things)

 
# Prerequisites
You should know something of xml language, you should know xml fundamentals, to understand
what xmlux does. If you need to study basic subjects or advanced matters, you could 
refer e.g. to Elliotte Rusty Harold's XML works, to w3c's XML space.  


# Installing and help
I thought xmlux for a Unix system, I tested it in a Unix system.
```bash
tar xvf xmlux-$version.tar.xz
cd xmlux-$version.tar.xz
./install-sh
systemctl reboot
xmlux -h
xmluxc -h
```

# Usage
See README/doc/xmluxDoc-xmlux/xmluxDoc.xml
